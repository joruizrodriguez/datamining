# datamining
Yelp data project

Some questions:

How many words should we pick as the "most common words"?  Is 1000 enough?

Can we exclude words like "it", "and", "the" etc. ?

Will the data be stored as a tuple [data_set, rating], or will it just be one list with the rating stored as the last value in each row?
